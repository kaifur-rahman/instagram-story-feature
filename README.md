# 📱 Instagram Story Feature Clone

This project is a **mobile-only Instagram-style story viewer** built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Material UI (MUI)**. It mimics the core functionality of stories in Instagram — including timed transitions, image preloading, navigation buttons, and a **dynamic progress bar** for each story.

> 🔒 Best viewed on mobile — the layout is optimized for small screens only!

## 🧠 Learnings & Challenges

- Syncing **image load** with **transition delay** required careful coordination using `onload` and `setTimeout`.
- Building a **responsive, animated progress bar** synced with the story timer was the most fun and challenging part.
- Restricted the view for desktops with a user-friendly message to mimic Instagram UX.

Let me know if you want me to include deployment instructions (like Netlify/Vercel), or if you've used TypeScript or added animations with Framer Motion — I can tailor it accordingly.
